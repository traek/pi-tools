# pi-tools
Just a place for me to put some randomly helpful scripts for running on a Raspberry Pi as a development workstation on Raspberry Pi OS.

## Scripts
It is recommended these scripts be placed in a directory that is in your user's path (e.g. `~/bin`) and set to executable.
### raspipress.py
* **Usage:** `raspipress.py` (no script parameters)
* **Description:** Simple script to download all Raspberry Pi Press free books and magazines, by default for the [Bookshelf](https://github.com/raspberrypi-ui/bookshelf) app (see definition of [`localPath`](https://github.com/traek/pi-tools/blob/main/raspipress.py#L15)).
